I recently became interested in non-standard dice (dice with numbers on them other than the usual 1 to 6). There are for example [intransitive dice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intransitive_dice), the rock-paper-scissors of the dice world.

I was thinking along these lines and came up with the following question: 
>Suppose we have a bag of dice where each die has a set of 6 randomly chosen different [prime numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_number) on it.
>
>Imagine a person randomly takes a dice from the bag and conducts n trials in secret. 
>
>For each trial, they roll the dice twice, multiply the two numbers they get together, and write down the result. 
>
>Then they pass us only the list of results. 
>
>Is there any way for us to work out what the numbers on their die were, just from the results and just using Pandas?
