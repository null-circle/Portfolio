    "## The Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "We are given a 1000 line text file where each line represents a pair of 5-card poker hands. \n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "8C TS KC 9H 4S 7D 2S 5D 3S AC\n",
    "5C AD 5D AC 9C 7C 5H 8D TD KS\n",
    "3H 7H 6S KC JS QH TD JC 2D 8S\n",
    "...\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Each card is encoded as rank+suit: \"8C\" = Eight of clubs, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first five cards are player 1's hand and the second five are player 2's hand.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal is for us to determine, for each pair of hands, who was the winner, applying the standard ranking of poker hands, so that we can find out how many hands player 1 won.\n",
    "\n",
    "Poker hand evaluation is quite complex. In order from lowest rank to highest we have:\n",
    "\n",
    "- High Card: Highest value card.\n",
    "- One Pair: Two cards of the same value.\n",
    "- Two Pairs: Two different pairs.\n",
    "- Three of a Kind: Three cards of the same value.\n",
    "- Straight: All cards are consecutive values.\n",
    "- Flush: All cards of the same suit.\n",
    "- Full House: Three of a kind and a pair.\n",
    "- Four of a Kind: Four cards of the same value.\n",
    "- Straight Flush: All cards are consecutive values of same suit.\n",
    "- Royal Flush: Ten, Jack, Queen, King, Ace, in same suit.\n",
    "\n",
    "So if player 1 has a Full House and player 2 has Three of a Kind, player 1 wins. But if both players have, say, Three of a Kind, then we have to apply additional rules to determine the winner (for Three of a Kind, the player with the highest card in the Three of a Kind). \n",
    "\n",
    "__You might reasonably ask what this has to do with data analysis:__ we are (probably) never going to be asked to analyse poker hands in real life. But we can imagine some analysis like this being needed in a real business task: for example, we could be analysing sales of a service to customers where the customer can choose different \"modules\" to be part of the service and perhaps the \"value\" for the company of selling different combinations of modules is different from simply the retail price - maybe some combinations correlate with longer customer retention, or with increased tech support revenue down the line, etc. So the company might present us with a ranked list of how to value sales of different combinations and this is not so different from a ranking of poker hands. \n"
