Three data analysts hard at work, around 1535.

## About Me

My name is __Mark Richards__. I've been a data analyst for about ten years, for the past three working in trade compliance and before that in production, inventory and processes, using SQL, Pandas, Matplotlib, Excel and PowerQuery to provide answers to stakeholders on business tasks of all kinds. I have a Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate and also know R and the Tidyverse.

In the old days, prospectors would take gravel from a riverbed into a wide pan and wash and sift it carefully, removing the soil and rocks, until all that remained was the tiny fragments of gold that they sought. 

Data analysis is just like that: by cleaning and transforming data the gold hidden within it can be found. And although doing this can be challenging, it is also really fun :). 

## Case Studies

I've included some examples of my work in Python, SQL, and R. 

- __Olympic Games__: This is a study of the mean ages of male and female Olympic athletes over all Summer Olympic Games from 1896 to 2020.

    1. Python - Summer Olympic Games.ipynb: This is a Python Jupyter notebook containing the principle analysis.
    2. SQL - Summer Olympic Games.sql: This is a replication of the same analysis using only SQL.
