_Three data analysts hard at work, 1535._

## About Me

In the old days, people looking for gold would take gravel from a riverbed into a wide pan and wash and sift it carefully - the gold was there, tiny fragments mixed in with all the rocks and dirt, but it was hard to find without a lot of work. Persistence, however, could (and sometimes did) make them rich. This is pretty much what data analysis is: with enough work and ingenuity _data_ can be turned into _information_, the gold every business needs to be successful.

My name is __Mark Richards__. I've been a data analyst for about ten years, for the past three working in trade compliance and before that in production, inventory and processes, using SQL, Python/Pandas, Excel and PowerQuery to provide answers to stakeholders on business tasks of all kinds. I have a Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate and also know R and the Tidyverse. Below are some examples of my work.

## Case Studies

* __Royal Flush__: This is an analyis of a data file containing 1000 pairs of poker hands to determine the winner, using Python/Pandas to make a complex series of evaluations.
* __Olympic Games__: This is a study of the mean ages of male and female Olympic athletes over all Summer Olympic Games from 1896 to 2020, in Python/Pandas and then replicated in SQL.
* __Github Developer Programming Languages and Technologies__: This is a study of the most popular programming languages and technologies of Github developers based on the top 1000 starred repositories, a simple little exercise using Python/Pandas.
