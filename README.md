Three data analysts hard at work, around 1535.

## About Me

My name is __Mark Richards__. I've been a data analyst for about ten years, for the past three working in trade compliance and before that in production, inventory and processes, using SQL, Pandas, Matplotlib, Excel and PowerQuery to provide answers to stakeholders on business tasks of all kinds. I have a Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate and also know R and the Tidyverse.

In the old days, prospectors would take gravel from a riverbed into a wide pan and wash and sift it carefully, removing the soil and rocks, until all that remained was the tiny fragments of gold that they sought. 

Data in and of itself has little value - it's basically gravel. But by cleaning and transforming that data, the gold hidden within it can be found. That is what orginally led me into data analysis and that is what keeps me working in the field.

## Case Studies

I've included some examples of my work in SQL, R and Python. These are mostly small targeted business tasks of the kind commonly used in interviews. I've tried to include explanations of my thought processes and considerations in each one.
