# Olympic Games

This is a dataset of Olympic athletes competing in Summer Olympic games from 1896 to 2020 produced by Nitish Sharma and available at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nitishsharma01/olympics-124-years-datasettill-2020 under a CC0: Public Domain license.

## Questions

The questions I'd like to address revolve around the __age__ of the athletes:

- Is there any change in the mean age of male and female competitors over the 124 years the data covers?
- Is there any change in the mean age of male and female medal winners over the same period?
