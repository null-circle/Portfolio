This is an R case study based open source data provided by Lyft Bikes and Scooters LLC who operate the city of Chicagoâ€™s Divvy bike sharing service, which allows people to hire bicycles from any of 600+ bike stations across Chicago for short-duration trips.

Further information on the Divvy bike service data can be found at ["https://ride.divvybikes.com/system-data"](https://ride.divvybikes.com/system-data).
The data itself is available at ["https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html"](https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html) and has been provided for use under the following agreement ["https://ride.divvybikes.com/data-license-agreement"](https://ride.divvybikes.com/data-license-agreement).

## Business Task

Divvy have two types of users: __annual members__ and __casual users__. Annual memberships are more profitable for the company than casual users. We need to explore the data we have, a 12 month period of cycle hire trip data, to identify differences in service use between casual users and annual members, which could later form a basis for a strategy to increase annual memberships.
